# WinProtect
This piece of code protects files from being deleted, read, renamed, etc. unless you have admin rights \
Files to protect are given in templates.tbl (file1*.txt, file2.doc, etc.)\
The program can be stopped by inserting a password (stored in a hashed form in the first line of templates.tbl)
